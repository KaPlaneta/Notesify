# Notesify

Mobile application for writing MIDI signal in musical notation, dedicated to Android users.
This application is used to write notes in real time.
For this purpose, a MIDI controller was used, the protocol of which transfers sets of commands via the USB port connected to the phone.
This way, the user playing the control keyboard, notices the appearing notes on the music staff.
The project contains the implementation of a multifunctional algorithm that allows to read and write a signal in the form of notes.
The application was programmed in React Native, using JavaScript.
